/// Implements a Day/Night cycle relative to the game world, with a World-Time clock, and optional Direcitonal Light control.
/// </summary>
/// <!-- 
/// Version 0.0.1.0 (beta)
/// By Reed Kimble
/// Last Revision 5/19/2011
/// -->
/// <remarks>
/// Add this script to a new GameObject to create a Day/Night cycle for the scene. The day/night cycle effect is achieved by modifying the
/// scene ambient light color, fog color, and skybox material.  The script will also rotate, fade, and enable/disable a directional
/// light if one is attached to the same GameObject as the DayNightController script.  The length of a complete day (in seconds) and the number of
/// hours per day are modifiable in the script fields and allow calculation of the World-time hour-of-day.  Each 'phase' of the day is considered
/// to be 1/4 of the dayCycleLength.
/// 
/// Note that the script will rotate the GameObject transform it is attached to, even if no directional light is attached. You will probably want to 
/// use a dedicated GameObject for this script and any attached directional light.
/// 
/// The GameObject with this script should be placed roughly in the center of your scene, with a height of about 2/3 the length (or width) of the terrain.
/// If that GameObject has a light, it should be a directional light pointed straight down (x:90, y:0, z:0).  This light will then be rotated around its
/// x-axis (relative to the scene; eg. as if you used the rotation tool locked on the green x axis) and will reach its horizontal peeks during the
/// end of dusk and beginning of dawn, turning off during the night (upside-down rotation).
/// 
/// The reset command will attempt to use the default skybox assets DawnDusk, Sunny2, and StarryNight if that package has been imported.  The
/// command will also choose acceptable color values and set the day cycle to two minutes. It is suggested that the directional light be a light-
/// yellow or peach in color with a roughly 0.33f intensity.  The script will not set any default values for the light, if one exists, so the light
/// must be configured manually.
